Title: HW3 Class 1 Survey Analysis

Author: Byeongju Ryu

1. What the project does?
  This project was created to complete Homework 3 (HW3) for the Advanced Data Analysis class at the Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis. The purpose of HW3 is for students to familiarize themselves with R language and RStudio software. Through this project, I analyzed survey data collected from students during the first session of the class. The survey gathered informal information that could help students get to know each other. The details can be found in the original survey data available on Dr. Kim Johnson's GitHub: https://github.com/kijohnson/ADA-2024/blob/main/Class%201%20(Getting%20started%20and%20RR%20I)/Lab/Class%201%20Survey%20Fall%202024_di.csv

2. Why the project is useful?
  This project serves as an excellent tool for beginners to practice R and RStudio. The R Markdown file documents basic commands for data exploration and descriptive analysis, along with explanations of each command.
